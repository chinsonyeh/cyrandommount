v1.2.4

### Features
1. Added CurseForge automatic packaging support for easier distribution.
2. Added a "Reset Macro" button in the Options panel, allowing users to reset the CYRandomMount macro if it is not working.

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed the "/cyrandommount" command so it now correctly opens the Options panel.
